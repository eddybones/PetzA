TrsFileVersion Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unzip the files and place the RSFILEVERSION.PAS file in a directory in
Delphi's search path. Place the FILEVERS.HLP file into the directory which
contains Delphi's help files. If you are using Delphi 2, move the
FILEVERS.KWF file into the DELPHI\HELP directory. The remaining files are
connected with the TrsFileVersion Demo program, and may be placed anywhere.

For Delphi 2, to install the TrsFileVersion help, get into the HelpInst
program and open the DELPHI.HDX file (it should be in DELPHI\BIN). Click
on the Plus button and add the FILEVERS.KWF file to the index. Save the
file and exit the program.

You can use TrsFileVersion in your programs by adding rsFileVersion to your
'Uses' clause. See the demo program for usage.
